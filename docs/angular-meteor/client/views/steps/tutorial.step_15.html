# Step 15 - Pagination

Now we are dealing with a few parties.
But we need to support also a large number of parties.

In that case, we want to have pagination support.

With pagination we can break the array of parties down to pages so the user won't have to scroll down to find a party,
but also and even more important, we can fetch only a few parties at a time instead of all the parties collection for better performance.

# angular-meteor pagination support

First thing, let's add support for the built-in pagination for the parties collection in partiesList.js.

All you need to do is add 'true' in the fifth parameter.

    $collection(Parties).bind($scope, 'parties', true, true, true).then(

Now the bind method is watching on 2 scope parameters:

1. $scope.perPage - A variable that holds how many objects we want to display in each page
2. $scope.page - A variable that holds the current page number

To handle those we need to define them in our scope:

    $scope.page = 1;
    $scope.perPage = 3;


# pagination directive

In AngularJS's eco system there are a lot of directive for handling pagination.

Our personal favorite is [angular-utils-pagination](https://github.com/michaelbromley/angularUtils/tree/master/src/directives/pagination).

To add the directive add it's Meteor package to the project:

    meteor add urigo:angular-utils-pagination

Add it as a dependency to our Angular app in app.js:

    angular.module('socially',[
      'angular-meteor',
      'ui.router',
      'google-maps'.ns(),
      'angularUtils.directives.dirPagination'
    ]);


Now let's add the directive in parties-list.html. change the ng-repeat of parties to this:

    <li dir-paginate="party in parties | itemsPerPage: perPage | filter:search | orderBy:orderProperty"
        class="party" total-items="partiesCount.count">

and after the UL closes add this directive:

    <dir-pagination-controls on-page-change="pageChanged(newPageNumber)"></dir-pagination-controls>

as you can see, dir-paginate list takes the number of objects in array (that we defined before) but also takes the total number items (we will get to that soon).
On the dir-pagination-controls directive there is a method on-page-change and there we can call our own function.

let's create the pageChanged function inside the partiesList.js:

    $scope.pageChanged = function(newPage) {
      $scope.page = newPage;
    };

Now every time we will change the page, the scope variable will change accordingly and update the bind method that watches it.

# Getting total count of a collection

Getting a total count of a collection might seem easy, but there is a problem.
The client only holds the number of object that it subscribed to. that means that if the client is not subscribed to the whole array calling find().count on a collection will result in a partial count.

So we need access in the client for the total count even if we are not subscribed to the whole collection.

For that we can use the [tmeasday:publish-counts](https://github.com/percolatestudio/publish-counts) package. In the command line:

    meteor add tmeasday:publish-counts


That package helps to publish the count of a cursor, in real time without dependency on the subscribe method.

Inside the server -> parties.js file, add the following code inside the Meteor.publish("parties" function, at the beginning of the function. before the existing return statement:

    Counts.publish(this, 'numberOfParties', Parties.find({
      $or:[
        {$and:[
          {"public": true},
          {"public": {$exists: true}}
        ]},
        {$and:[
          {owner: this.userId},
          {owner: {$exists: true}}
        ]},
        {$and:[
          {invited: this.userId},
          {invited: {$exists: true}}
        ]}
    ]}));

Now on the client we have access to the Counts collection. let's subscribe to that in the partiesList.js file:

    $collection(Counts).bindOne($scope, 'partiesCount', 'numberOfParties');

Now the partiesCount will hold the number of parties and will send it to the directive in the parties-list.html (which we already defined earlier).

Now run the app.
Create lots of parties and see that you can see only 3 at a time and you can scroll between the pages with the directive that populates the number of pages automatically.
