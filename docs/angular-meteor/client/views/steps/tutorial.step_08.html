# Step 8 - User accounts and permissions

One of Meteor's most powerful packages is the Meteor account system.

Right now, our app is publishing all the parties to all the clients and all the clients can change those parties and the changes are reflected back to all
the other clients automatically.

This is super powerful and easy, but what about security?  We don't want anyone to be able to change any party...

First thing we should do is to remove the 'insecure' package that automatically added to any new Meteor application.

The 'insecure' package makes the default behaviour of Meteor collections to permit all.

By removing that package the default behaviour is changed to deny all.

So first execute this command in the command line:

    meteor remove insecure


Now let's try to change the parties array or a specific party.  Nothing's working.

Now, we will have to write an explicit security rule for each operation we want to make on the Mongo collection.

So first, let's add the 'accounts-password' Meteor package.
it's a very powerful package for all the user operations you can think of: Login, signup, change password, password recovery, email confirmation and more..

     meteor add accounts-password

Now we will also add the 'accounts-ui' package.  That package contains all the HTML and CSS we need for the user operation forms.

Later on in this tutorial we will replace those default account-ui forms with a custom Angular forms.

    meteor add accounts-ui

Now let's add the accounts-ui template ( {> loginButtons }} ) into our app, into index.html.

To add Meteor's templates into AngularJS templates, angular-meteor provides us with the meteor-include directive.

So instead of adding {> loginButtons }} like in Meteor we will add <meteor-include src="loginButtons"></meteor-include> :

__`index.html`:__

      <body>

      <div>
        <meteor-include src="loginButtons"></meteor-include>
        <h1>
          <a href="/parties">Home</a>
        </h1>
        <div ui-view></div>
      </div>

      </body>


Run the code, create an account, login, logout...

Now that we have our account system, we can start defining our security rules for the parties.

Let's go to the model folder and change the file to look like this:

__`model/parties.js`:__

    Parties = new Mongo.Collection("parties");

    Parties.allow({
      insert: function (userId, party) {
        return userId && party.owner === userId;
      },
      update: function (userId, party, fields, modifier) {
        if (userId !== party.owner)
          return false;

        return true;
      },
      remove: function (userId, party) {
        if (userId !== party.owner)
          return false;

        return true;
      }
    });

The collection.allow function defines the permissions that the client needs to write directly to the collection (like we did until now).

In each callback of action type (insert, update, remove) the functions should return true if they think the operation should be allowed.
Otherwise they should return false, or nothing at all (undefined).

The available callbacks are:

* insert(userId, doc)

  The user userId wants to insert the document doc into the collection. Return true if this should be allowed.

  doc will contain the _id field if one was explicitly set by the client, or if there is an active transform. You can use this to prevent users from specifying arbitrary _id fields.

* update(userId, doc, fieldNames, modifier)

  The user userId wants to update a document doc. (doc is the current version of the document from the database, without the proposed update.) Return true to permit the change.

  fieldNames is an array of the (top-level) fields in doc that the client wants to modify, for example ['name', 'score'].

  modifier is the raw Mongo modifier that the client wants to execute; for example, {$set: {'name.first': "Alice"}, $inc: {score: 1}}.

  Only Mongo modifiers are supported (operations like $set and $push). If the user tries to replace the entire document rather than use $-modifiers, the request will be denied without checking the allow functions.

* remove(userId, doc)

  The user userId wants to remove doc from the database. Return true to permit this.


In our example:

* insert - only if the user who makes the insert is the party owner.
* update - only if the user who makes the update is the party owner.
* remove - only if the user who deletes the party is the party owner.


OK, right now none of the parties has an owner so we can't change any of them.

So let's add the following simple code to define an owner for each party that gets created.

Let's take our current user's id and set it as the owner id of the party we are creating.
angular-meteor provides us with a $rootScope variable named currentUser that holds the current user record, or null if no user is logged in.

[$rootScope](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$rootScope) is the most upper scope in the application.
Every application has a single root scope. All other scopes are descendant scopes of the root scope.

To access $rootScope inside a controller you add it through the dependency injection.
To access $rootScope in a template you simply write $root. and then the name of the property.

Change the code for the add button in parties-list.html to this:

    <button ng-click="newParty.owner=$root.currentUser._id; parties.push(newParty)">Add</button>

So first we set the new party's owner to our current user's id and then push it to the parties collection like before.

Now, start the app in 2 different browsers and login with 2 different users.

Test editing and removing your own parties, and try to do the same for parties owned by another user.

# Social login

We also want to let users login with their Facebook and Twitter accounts.

To do this, we simply need to add the right packages in the console:

    meteor add accounts-facebook
    meteor add accounts-twitter

Now run the app.  when you will first press the login buttons of the social login, meteor will show you a wizard that will help you define your app.

You can also skip the wizard and configure it manually like the explanation here: [http://docs.meteor.com/#meteor_loginwithexternalservice](http://docs.meteor.com/#meteor_loginwithexternalservice)

There are more social login services you can use:

* Facebook
* Github
* Google
* Meetup
* Twitter
* Weibo
* Meteor developer account

# Summary

Amazing, only few lines of code and we have a secure application!

The next step will take care of privacy, not showing users parties they are not allowed to see.
